This repository contains 10 beginner-friendly Machine Learning and AI projects implemented using Python. Each project explores different ML concepts, algorithms, and libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and NLTK.

📌 Projects Overview
1. 🔢 Python Calculator

A simple calculator built using Python.

Supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Great starting point for understanding Python functions and user input handling.

2. ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST Dataset)

Dataset: MNIST (images of handwritten digits).

Frameworks: TensorFlow & Keras.

Task: Train a Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits.

Key Steps:

Load the dataset:

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()


Normalize and train using a dense neural network.

Output: Predict digits (0–9) from images.

3. 💬 Simple Chatbot

Implements a rule-based chatbot.

Handles simple conversational queries using Python and basic NLP.

Can be extended with ML models for intelligent dialogue systems.

4. 📧 Spam Email Detection (Linear Regression)

Detects spam vs. non-spam emails.

Uses Linear Regression for classification.

Steps:

Preprocess text data (tokenization, vectorization).

Train Linear Regression model.

Evaluate accuracy on test data.

5. 📱 Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier.

Task: Predict user activities (e.g., walking, sitting, standing) based on accelerometer and gyroscope data.

Applications: Wearable fitness devices, smart health monitoring.

6. 😀 Sentiment Analysis on Text Data (NLTK)

Dataset: User reviews / sample text data.

Library: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).

Task: Classify text into positive or negative sentiment.

Steps:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal).

Feature extraction using Bag of Words or TF-IDF.

Train a classifier and evaluate.

7. 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Cosine Similarity)

Uses cosine similarity on movie descriptions / metadata.

Task: Recommend movies similar to a given movie.

Approach:

Convert text features into vectors.

Compute cosine similarity between vectors.

Recommend top-N similar movies.

8. 🏠 House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

Dataset: Housing data (features like size, location, rooms).

Algorithm: Linear Regression.

Task: Predict house prices based on input features.

Real-world application in real estate market analysis.

9. 🌦️ Weather Prediction (Linear Regression)

Dataset: Historical weather data (temperature, humidity, rainfall).

Algorithm: Linear Regression.

Task: Predict future weather conditions (e.g., temperature).

Simple yet powerful regression-based forecasting example.

10. 📈 Sigmoid Activation Function & Its Derivative
